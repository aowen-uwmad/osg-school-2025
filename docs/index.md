<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?</p>

*Learn how during a week this summer at the lovely [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://wisc.edu/)*

During the School,
you will learn to use [high-throughput computing](https://htcondor.org/htc.html) (HTC) systems —
at your own campus or using the national-scale [OSG](https://osg-htc.org/) —
to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science.

Through lectures, discussions, and **lots of hands-on activities** with experienced OSG staff,
you will learn how HTC systems work,
how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow,
and where to turn for more information and help.

The school is ideal for graduate students in any research area
for which large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process,
plus we welcome applications from advanced undergraduates, post-doctoral students, faculty, and staff
(especially staff who perform research or support/facilitate researchers).

People accepted to this program will receive financial support for
basic travel and local costs associated with the School.
