<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Could you transform your research with vast amounts of computing?</p>

*Learn how this summer at the lovely [University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://wisc.edu/)*

During the School,
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: #FF6600;">August 5&ndash;9</span>,
you will learn to use [high-throughput computing](https://htcondor.org/htc.html) (HTC) systems
&mdash;
at your own campus or
using the national-scale [Open Science Pool](https://osg-htc.org/services/open_science_pool.html)
&mdash;
to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today’s cutting-edge science.

Through lectures, discussions, and **lots of hands-on activities** with experienced OSG staff,
you will learn how HTC systems work,
how to run and manage lots of jobs and huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow,
and where to get more information and help.

The school is ideal for:

*   Researchers (especially graduate students and post-docs) in any research area
    for which large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process;

*   Anyone (especially students and staff) who supports researchers
    who are current or potential users of high-throughput computing;

*   Instructors (at the post-secondary level) who teach future researchers and
    see value in integrating high-throughput computing into their curriculum.

People accepted to this program will receive financial support for
basic travel and local costs associated with the School.


## Applications

Applications are now closed for 2024.
The deadline for applications was Monday, 1 April 2024.

If still needed,
have someone email a letter of recommendation for you to
[school@osg-htc.org](mailto:school@osg-htc.org)
(ideally PDF or plain text)

For the letter of recommendation, ask someone who knows you professionally&nbsp;&mdash;
ideally a faculty member or other supervisor.
They should clearly identify your name and the “OSG School 2024” in the subject line and letter,
so that we can associate your application and letter.

**Applicants:**
We plan to review applications in April and invite participants by early May or so.
We will contact you once decisions have been made. Thank you for your patience!
