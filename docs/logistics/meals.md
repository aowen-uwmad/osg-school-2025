Other meals not listed above are on your own.

If you are **not** a member of the UW&ndash;Madison community,
we will reimburse you for the on-your-own meals,
Monday through Thursday dinners;
see below for details.
Sorry, UW&ndash;Madison folks: The rules say that we cannot reimburse you for meals here.

For the meals on your own, you are welcome to join other participants and even staff!
We can help with ideas and groups, if you like.
There is [another page](dining.md) with suggestions for finding dining options near the School and hotel.

## Catered Meals

The catered breakfasts and lunches during the School (see above)
will be served in the Computer Sciences Building.
Breakfast is in the main auditorium, [room 1240](location.md),
and lunch is nearby (staff will lead the way on Monday).
There is nearby seating both inside and outside.

## Menus

The catered meals should take into account all dietary needs that you told us about in the questionnaire.
Check for labels!
If you have questions, ask the catering staff (if present) or School staff.

Some items,
like gluten-free items,
are provided in low quantities that are meant just for those people who requested them.
Please do not take them unless they are for you.
