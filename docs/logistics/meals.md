# Meal Information

The School includes some group catered meals for all participants:

*   Sunday (Jun. 22) &mdash; welcome dinner
*   Monday (Jun. 23) &ndash; Friday (Jun. 27) &mdash; breakfast and lunch each day
*   Friday (Jun. 27) &mdash; closing dinner

Other meals not listed above are on your own.

If you are **not** a member of the UW&ndash;Madison community,
we will reimburse you for the on-your-own meals,
Monday through Thursday dinners;
see below for details.
Sorry, UW&ndash;Madison folks: The rules say that we cannot reimburse you for meals here.

For the meals on your own, you are welcome to join other participants and even staff!
We can help with ideas and groups, if you like.
There is [another page](dining.md) with suggestions for finding dining options near the School and hotel.

## Catered Meals

The catered breakfasts and lunches during the School (see above)
will be served in the Computer Sciences Building.
Breakfast is in the main auditorium, [room 1240](location.md),
and lunch is nearby (staff will lead the way on Monday).
There is nearby seating both inside and outside.

## Menus

The catered meals should take into account all dietary needs that you told us about in the questionnaire.
Check for labels!
If you have questions, ask the catering staff (if present) or School staff.

Some items,
like gluten-free items,
are provided in low quantities that are meant just for those people who requested them.
Please do not take them unless they are for you.

## Meal Reimbursement Tips

Again, if you are **not** part of the UW&ndash;Madison community,
we can reimburse you for dinners Monday through Thursday.
We have curated a page of some possible [dining options](./dining.md) to use as inspiration.

Some tips for successful reimbursements:

*   Keep receipts for your meals â€“ if anything so that you remember how much meals cost!

*   We can reimburse up to $35 for dinner, including tax and tip.

*   If it is not on the receipt, be sure to write the tip amount yourself, so you do not forget.

*   We cannot pay for any alcohol, although non-alcoholic drinks are OK&nbsp;&mdash;
    ideally, pay for alcohol separately.

We will explain the reimbursement process in detail after the School, but the tips above will help.
