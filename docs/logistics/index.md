## General Information About the School Schedule

### Travel Schedule

Most participants should plan to travel as follows:

-   **Arrive on Sunday, August 4, 2024,** by about 5:00 p.m. (if possible).
    There is a welcome dinner on Sunday evening for all participants (including instructors),
    and then classes begin on Monday morning.
    This is a nice way to get to know each other and start the week.

-   **Depart on Saturday, August 10, 2024,** any time.
    The School ends with a closing dinner on Friday evening,
    so it is best to stay that night.

If we offered to pay for your hotel room, we will pay for the 6 nights of this schedule.

**Note:** If we suggested other travel dates to you in an email, then use those dates instead!

### School Hours

The School is generally Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to about 5:00 p.m.,
except Wednesday afternoon.
There will be optional work sessions on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings.

A detailed schedule will be posted before the event.
