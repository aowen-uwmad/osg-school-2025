Learn how this summer at the lovely University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison During the School \u2014 June 23\u201327 , \u2014 you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems, at your own campus or using the national-scale Open Science Pool , to run large-scale computing applications that are at the heart of today\u2019s cutting-edge science. Through lectures, discussions, and lots of hands-on activities with experienced OSG staff, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage long lists of computing tasks and work with huge datasets to implement a scientific computing workflow, and where to turn for more information and help. The School is ideal for: Researchers (especially graduate students and post-docs) in any research area for which large-scale computing is a vital part of the research process; Anyone (especially students and staff) who supports researchers who are current or potential users of high-throughput computing; Instructors (at the post-secondary level) who teach future researchers and see value in integrating high-throughput computing into their curriculum. People accepted to this program will receive financial support for basic travel and local costs associated with the School. Applications \u00b6 We plan to open applications in mid- to late January and to stop taking applications on Friday, March 7. Please check back here for updates and a link to the application form. Contact Us \u00b6 The OSG School is the premier training event of the OSG Consortium and is held annually at UW\u2013Madison.
